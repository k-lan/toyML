# toyML
A variety machine learning solutions to some public datasets.
ML strategies used here on public housing data and common MNIST handwritten digit dataset. kNN, linear regressin, and multinomail regression methods are all used.

To run any of the datasets, install these dependencies:
- ```pip install numpy```
- ```pip install scipy```
- ```pip install matplotlib```

Additionally, since training the data on these datasets can take a long time, I have provided my trained data as well, all trained data is in the format 'filename.npy' for ease of running and viewing graphs/results.

Code written for statistical processing methods course.
